# There are default installation instructions needed for Ubuntu12.10
# For Ubuntu10.xx (python3.1, not 3.3) you should modify bs4 library
# in a way that "from .. import _htmlparser" becomes "from . import"

#if you need to
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
# If you do not have python3 as a default, then
# NO MORE. I just added bs4 in the project directory
#sudo cp -r /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/bs4/ /usr/local/lib/python3.2/dist-packages/
#sudo 2to3 -w /usr/lib/python3.2/dist-packages/bs4
